Oh-My-Zsh Installer script 
</p></h1>

- For Debian Base Distro and Ubuntu only.


- This is not a fork of Oh My Zsh, This is an automated installer for Ubuntu or Debian Based Distro.

- Since I keep on changing my device and Love Zsh a lot I decided to automate it because I'm tired of reading the documentation and I guess that's what bash scipting is all about .... LOL.
